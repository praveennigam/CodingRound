    },
    {
      "question": "What are the differences between synchronous and asynchronous programming in JavaScript?",
      "answer": "Synchronous programming executes tasks sequentially, one after another. Asynchronous programming allows tasks to be executed in the background, so the code doesn't wait for a task to complete and can move on to other tasks, improving efficiency in handling I/O operations."

    {
      "question": "What is the `call`, `apply`, and `bind` methods in JavaScript?",
      "answer": "`call()` and `apply()` are used to invoke a function with a specified `this` value and arguments. `call()` passes arguments individually, while `apply()` passes them as an array. `bind()` returns a new function that, when called, has its `this` set to the provided value."
